## Elliptical Curves
1. Language = Python 3.6.4
2. To run the program, one needs to run the command "python3 ec.py".
3. After this, all the placeholder commands inside the program testing out every operation and function will run.
4. The format of the points is as follows - [x,y]. The arguments need to passed into this format for the program to run properly.
5. The EC Domain parameters will be found in the file called 'variables.txt'. Changes to the curve must be made here.
6. The outputs will be saved in the file named 'output.txt'.
